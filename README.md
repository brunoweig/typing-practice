# Typing Practice

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Some things are so obvious they can be easily overlooked. As a developer 
your ability to type quickly and accurately is one factor that influences 
your development productivity. The objective of the Typing Practice app is
to provide you with typing practice along with metrics to allow you to
measure your progress.

Typing practice displays a word which you must then type within a specific
interval of time. If the word is incorrectly typed it stays on
screen and the time interval remains the same. But when the word is correctly 
typed a new word is displayed and the time interval is slightly reduced.

Hopefully, this repetitive practice will help you improve both your typing
speed and accuracy.
